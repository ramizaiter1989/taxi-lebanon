## I want to use a custom domain - is that possible?

For web deployments, you can use custom domains with:

- **EAS Hosting** - Custom domains available on paid plans
- **Netlify** - Free custom domain support
- **Vercel** - Custom domains with automatic SSL

For mobile apps, you'll configure your app's deep linking scheme in `app.json`.

## Troubleshooting

### **App not loading on device?**

1. Make sure your phone and computer are on the same WiFi network
2. Try using tunnel mode: `bun start -- --tunnel`
3. Check if your firewall is blocking the connection

### **Build failing?**

1. Clear your cache: `bunx expo start --clear`
2. Delete `node_modules` and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && bun install`
3. Check [Expo's troubleshooting guide](https://docs.expo.dev/troubleshooting/build-errors/)
